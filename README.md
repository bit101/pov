# pov

pov is a Go library designed to create and render povray files. 

This is very much a case of me scratching an itch and will be mainly used for my own algorithmic/procedural image creation. As such, it's not going to be very full featured. Likely I'll add what I want if and when I need it and keep it as simple as possible.

All that said, if you see something useful here that you can borrow or use as is, amen.

All this is really doing so far is creating some Go structs that can be serialized into a povray description file. Barely past the proof-of-concept phase, pretty janky, a lot of hard coded stuff while I work out the details. I think there's a real opportunity here to use Go's templating system, so that will be one of the next things I explore.
